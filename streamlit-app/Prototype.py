In India, where mental health remains a taboo subject, individuals living with schizophrenia often face discrimination and social isolation, exacerbating their already considerable burden. Families caring for loved ones with schizophrenia grapple with emotional distress and financial strain, as they navigate a healthcare system ill-equipped to provide adequate support. Although the Indian government has made strides in addressing mental health through initiatives like the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, challenges persist in translating policy into effective action, particularly at the grassroots level. Furthermore, the stigma associated with speaking out about a mental illness is high.
