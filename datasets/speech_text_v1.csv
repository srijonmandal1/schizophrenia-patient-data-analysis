Makes me so tired. I told the doctor, but I don’t think he gets it. Not really. It feels like nobody understands. And the people staring doesn’t help. They look at me funny, whispering behind my back. It just makes me angrier. I try to smile, show them I’m okay, but inside I'm screaming. Why can’t they just leave me alone? The shadows are the worst. They sneak around, almost catching me, and then they're gone when I look again. It scares me. I hold onto my usual things, my routines, because without them, I feel like I’d just float away into some dark place.|04/01/2024
